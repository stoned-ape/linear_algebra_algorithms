This repo contains a matrix class with algorithms that implement matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It also contains algorithms for finding the determinant, the inverse, the characteristic polynomial, the eigen values, and the eigen vectors of a matrix.
To aid in finding the eigen values, I have created an approximate algorithm to find the roots of a polynomial of any order.
